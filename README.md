## Overview
This project integrates advanced machine learning (ML) models with Microsoft Power BI to enhance business intelligence capabilities beyond what Power BI currently offers. It focuses on demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supplier performance monitoring within the beauty supply chain.

## Abstract
The project introduces a novel approach by integrating ML models for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supplier performance monitoring into Power BI. This workflow involved data preprocessing, model training, and real-time ML integration, resulting in a robust Power BI dashboard that significantly enhances these business intelligence capabilities.

## Introduction
The beauty supply chain is highly competitive, facing challenges like fluctuating demand, inventory management, and supplier performance. This research integrates BI systems with ML to improve demand forecasting, optimize inventory, and monitor supplier performance, driving competitiveness in the beauty supply chain.

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition:** 
   - Source: Comprehensive dataset from Kaggle with 180,519 entries and 48 columns covering customer behavior, order details, product information, and shipping logistics.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Conducted EDA to gain insights into key variables, resulting in informative visualizations and summary statistics.
3. **Data Pre-processing:** 
   - Encoded categorical variables, removed outliers, and normalized numerical variables to enhance data reliability.
4. **Model Training:** 
   - Trained and validated various ML models with hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance, using cross-validation to minimize overfitting risks.

## Results
The best models were selected for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and supplier performance monitoring. The Power BI dashboard includes features for demand forecasting, inventory optimization, stockout prediction, lead time prediction, supplier performance analysis, and trend analysis, enabling informed decision-making and process optimization.

## Figures and Visualizations
The Power BI dashboard showcases demand forecasting visualizations, inventory management models, and supplier performance analysis, offering stakeholders dynamic data exploration and trend visualization for informed decision-making.

## Impact
The integration of ML models and BI tools has led to a transformative framework for optimizing supply chain processes in the beauty industry. This emphasizes the critical role of advanced analytics and real-time insights in achieving strategic adaptability and competitiveness.
